1 Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client purpose was to make sure that their target audience had a gaming experience through the web comapred to there original app game, the client is one that needed a transition of there game from the app based to the web based. software requirements was to use an operating system as well as the type of machine that will be capable of hosting the web-based game. The type of software that the company wanted to desgin is a software that allow for great security, image game experience through the web and host that allow for game to run smoothly

2 What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The part that I particullarly did well in this documentation is the fact that I correctly showed the issues that the client needed as well as the neccesary requirements that were needed to complete this mission.

3 What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think that the helpful part which allow to develop the code was the requirements that the client had for the developers which is what made it most important to make it precisely as the client wanted it to be developed.

4 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the part that I will revise out of my whole documentation will be the comparasing of the operating system because I feel I should had added more detail about what makes each operating more unique and I will have improved it by searching in the internet more examples that defined each operating system

5 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpret the user's needs by making sure that I had used the required software as well as the neccesary measurement to accomplishing the user's need and it is important to considered the users needs when designing because they are the main focus of the product since withouth the user the game wouldnt be as popular so understanding the user is key to making the software.

6 How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach desgining the software by understanding like I said before my client and user and understanding overall the necessity of completing the task in hand and the strategies I would use to do these future project in order to analyze software application is to build a desgined software document that will organized my ideas of what I need to do, what is important for the client, what is important for the user and how do I approach on the hardware as well as the software needed to accomplish everything.
